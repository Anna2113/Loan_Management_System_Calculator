## Loan_Management_System_Calculator

#### An application designed in Java using JavaFX elements.
#### After cloning the application, we run it in any idea such as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. We run the application using HelloControler.java class (path to file src/main/java/com/example/loanmanagementsystemcalculator/HelloController.java).
#### After running the application, the user is shown the login panel, for which the login and hsało are located in the Users floder.

W ramach projektu aplikacji, zostały utworzone testy jednostkowe w klasie HelloControllerTest.java *(ścieżka do pliku src/test/java/com/example/loanmanagementsystemcalculator/HelloControllerTest.java)*. Jeden z testów został przygotowany w taki sposób, aby nie przechodził poprawnie.
