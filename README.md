## Loan_Management_System_Calculator

#### An application designed in Java using JavaFX elements.
#### After cloning the application, we run it in any idea such as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. We run the application using HelloControler.java class (path to file src/main/java/com/example/loanmanagementsystemcalculator/HelloController.java).
#### After running the application, the user is shown the login panel, for which the login and hsa≈Ço are located in the Users floder.
